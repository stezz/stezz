### Hi there I am Stefano 👋

I used to be a sysadmin once upon a time, then somebody might have noticed that I was better at leading software engineers rather than coding myself, and my career as an Engineering manager started like that.

As you can see from the few projects I have here I still like to tinker with code in my spare time (which, given the amount of activity, you can conclude is little).

I also am a communication coach and I have a [Presentation Masterclass](https://britemind.teachable.com/p/masterclass) on Teachable that helps people to become better communicators, public speakers and presenters based on the [Presentation Design Canvas](https://presentationdesigncanvas.com/)

That's why you will find here a suite of scripts aimed at automating Teachable schools management, aptly called [Teachable School Manager](https://github.com/stezz/teachable-scripts).

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with putting a web interface in front of that set of scripts, if you have time you can reach me  📫 [here](mailto:stefano.mosconi@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun facts: while I am Italian I have been living for a long time in Finland. Not sure if that is fun though ☺️
- 🍕 I like to cook, especially pizza
